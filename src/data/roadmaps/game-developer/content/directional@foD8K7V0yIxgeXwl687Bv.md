# Directional Light

A **Directional Light** simulates a light source coming from an infinite distance, similar to sunlight. Unlike point lights, which emit light from a specific position, a **Directional Light** affects all objects in the scene uniformly, as if the light is coming from an infinite distance, sending parallel rays in a fixed direction.
