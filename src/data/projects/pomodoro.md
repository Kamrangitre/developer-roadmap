Create a Pomodoro time-management app that tracks how many times you have used the timer. Use the local storage feature available in browsers to store the information.

## Requirements

The tool must have the following features:

- The ability to start a timer that ends at either 25 or 5 minutes.
- The ability to pause the timer.
- The ability to reset the timer when paused.
- The user should be able to see total time spent in the timers.
- The browsers local storage must be used to persist the data saved between visits.

## Stretch Goals

- Allow the user to create projects where pomodoro time is assigned.
- Allow the user to add time during the running of the timer i.e. +1, +5, +10 etc.
