In this project, you will develop a CLI based Password Manager in Bash that allows users to store, retrieve, and manage their passwords securely using strong encryption methods such as GPG.

## Requirements

The tool should:

- Be password protected and restricted to only the assigned user.
- Allow the user to add, delete and view passwords.
- Suggest strong passwords.
- Use GPG to encrypt the password storage file.

## Stretch Goals

- Make the CLI interactive with navigation options rather than CLI arguments.
- Allow the user to share passwords with other (local) users.
