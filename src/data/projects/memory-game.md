In this project we will build a browser-based memory game where a user will memorize a pattern of colored buttons. As the player progresses, the sequence gets longer and more difficult, testing their memory and attention to detail. This project demonstrates core web development concepts such as DOM manipulation, event handling.

## Requirements

- The user is presented with 4 coloured buttons in a 2 by 2 layout.
- The user starts the game by pressing any button.
- The first level is one colour, and will increase by an extra colour each level.
- The next level must build on the previous level i.e. L1: a, L2: a,c L3: a,c,d.
- If the user fails to get the correct pattern the game is ended and the user is presented with a score.

## Stretch Goals

- Use local browser storage to keep the users high score.
- Update the experience with animations and sounds.
- Incorporate a timer to allow the user to also try to encorporate speed as well as accuracy.
