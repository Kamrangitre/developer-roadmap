In this project, we will be making a browser based quizz. The app will present users with a series of multiple-choice questions and after each question, the app will provide immediate feedback on whether the selected answer is correct or incorrect.

## Requirements

As the developer, feel free to define the questions as you see fit.

- The user will be initially present with a "start" button.
- When the user presses start they're presented with the first multiple choice question.
- The questions are to be presented as `cards` with the answers being buttons on the card.
- When the user selects an answer, the answer buttons are to turn red or green depending on the result.
- If the user answers correctly, a score is to be incremented.
- At the end of the quizz, the user is presented with a final score and all of the results.

## Stretch Goals

- Add a time limit to each question, skipping the question and give a 0 score if the limit is hit.
- Add the feature of user inputted answers for more complexity.
- Allow the user to share their results on social media.
