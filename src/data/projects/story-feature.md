You are required to build a "Story" feature similar to those found in popular social media platforms like Instagram and WhatsApp. The goal is to allow users to post short, ephemeral content that disappears after X hours. As this is a Frontend project this is going to be client-side only.

## Requirements

- The users avatar has a `+` icon in the bottom right which will act as an upload button.
- Users can upload an image or video.
- The user avatar is given a visually appealing border when a story is active.
- After the defined time, the story is no longer viewable and the avatar returns to the default state.

## Stretch Goals

- Multiple stories can be added and accessible via swipe functionality.
- Allow users to remove a live story.
